# Margin-Based-Loss
This is a **tensorflow** implementation of **margin based loss**.
See [sampling matters in deep embedding learning.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07567) for references.

Distance weighted sampling method, distance weighted triplet loss and margin based loss are implemented in this code.

The author of the paper `sampling matters in deep embedding learning` supplyed the 
[mxnet version](https://github.com/chaoyuaw/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/gluon/embedding_learning).
